			</p>
			<p>
				Step 3: After creating those two files, type in at the top <!doctype html>, then put an opening an closing tab, <html>(opening) </html>(closing).
			</p>
			<p>
				Step 4: Inside the html tags, add a head and a body tag which is similar to the html tag, except you replace html with head and body. make sure to that the tags are tabbed once to the right from the previous line.
