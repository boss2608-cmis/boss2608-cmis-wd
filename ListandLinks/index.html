				On this website, I will be showing you step by step how to create a website and uload it to the production server.
			</p>
		<ol>
				<li>
					Open Terminal which is an app in the bottom left corner of the screen with an icon that looks something like this: [>_ ]
				</li>
				<li>
					While in the Terminal, create a html file and a css file: index.html, main.css. to create this, type in gedit (index.html and/or main.css).
				</li>
				<li>
					After creating those two files, type in at the top <!doctype html>, then put an opening an closing tab, <html>(opening) </html>(closing).
				</li>
				<li>
					Inside the html tags, add a head and a body tag which is similar to the html tag, except you replace html with head and body. make sure to that the tags are tabbed once to the right from the previous line. 
				</li>
				<li>
					After adding the head and the body, you can create more tags within them such as title, which can be placed within the tag head. P for paragraph and h1 fro heading 1 cn be placed within the body tag which will then be shon on the website from the development server. If you want to view your website, you must start up the HTTP server by typing in python -m SimpleHTTPServer into the terminal, once it gets started, it will say Serving HTTP on (server). to view the website onlne, you need to type in localhost:8000 into the search bar. Once opened, the website should look blank because you haven't added anything to it yet.
				</li>
				<li>
	  				to add text to the html you need to type something within the tags without us < or >.
				</li>
				<li>
	  				 After yo are happy with what you have on the website, you will need to upload it to the production server. To upload it, you will need to access your account on the prodution server by typing in sftp (student name and id)@cmis-hsteacher into the terminal, it will then ask you this question: The authenticity of host 'cmis-hsteacher (10.0.10.10)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is 11:21:e3:af:61:48:9f:14:d4:4d:df:75:82:ea:45:a1.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? you will need to answer yes, it will only ask you this once. It will then ask you for your password which you should have by now.
				</li>
				<li>
					Once you are in the sftp server, go into the public_html\ file by typing cd public_html\. This will put you into the public folder which will allow you to upload your website. to upload it you will need to type put (filename) and press enter.
				</li>
				<li>
					To view your website from within the production server, you will need to type cmis-hsteacher~/username (student1234). This will open your website from the production server so you can view it.
